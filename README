For contributors
================

When adding or updating your extension, please adhere to these guidelines:

* Use ``make-ext.py`` to set up your extension subdirectory.
* Each extension must be either a submodule or subpackage of the
  ``sphinxcontrib`` package.  The ``sphinxcontrib/__init__.py`` file in your
  package must not be changed.
* Each extension must be listed in this file under "List of extensions" above.
* Each author should be listed in ``AUTHORS`` along with the extension name.
* It would be good to have all extensions BSD licensed; otherwise make a note in
  an ``ext/LICENSE`` file.
* Each extension can maintain a changelog and readme file; these files should
  be called ``ext/CHANGES`` and ``ext/README``, respectively.
