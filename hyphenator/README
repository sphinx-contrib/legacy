.. highlight:: rest

sphinxcontrib-hyphenator
========================

This extension provides hyphenation for html documentation generated
with sphinx_. It loads the JavaScript package hypenator.js_ to hyphenate
documents on client side.

Because hyphenator.js is quite large, it is not included in the extension.

.. confval:: hyphenator_path

   The path to the hyphenator.js file. 

   Default value is http://hyphenator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
   that loads the JavaScript from the project repository. If you want
   Hyphenator to be available offline, you have to download it and set this
   value to a different path.

   The path can be absolute or relative; if it is relative, it is relative to
   the ``_static`` directory of the built docs.






.. hypenator.js: http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/
