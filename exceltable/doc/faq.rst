Why rusty?
  I think that documentation *does not need* to be a **necessary evil**.
  With a flexible tools even developers kind enjoy writing documentation.

  Documentation framework `Sphinx`_ is an excellent tryout to make writing
  technical documents easier. With the `ReStructuredText`_ -documentation format
  it shows that it does not necessary have to be Word document - while providing
  advanced functionality to write or generate documentation. As fun as the
  document writing can be, we still want to get it does easily and fast, right?

  So, **why rusty, then**? `Rusty`_ is my push to support non-binary documents and
  provide some examples how the people can take the advantage from the ReST -
  and this is done by writing extensions that I've found useful while writing
  documents.

What's with the name?
  I like names that does not necessary mean anything but may sound like one.
  So, the name **Rusty** comes from:

  * Trust, trustworthy
  * tRuSTy => RST => ReStructuredText
  * Rust (?)
  * Python => py => rusTY

Development status of rusty?
  Or how ready rusty is for real usage?
