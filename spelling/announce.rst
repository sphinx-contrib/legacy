What is sphinxcontrib.spelling?
===============================

`sphinxcontrib.spelling`_ is a spelling checker for Sphinx_.  It uses
PyEnchant_ to produce a report showing misspelled words.

What's New in 1.2?
==================

This update checks the spelling of document titles and section headers
as well as the body of the document. It also fixes a packaging issue
that prevented the tests from working when run directly from the sdist
available on PyPI.
