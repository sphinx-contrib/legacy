What is sphinxcontrib.spelling?
===============================

`sphinxcontrib.spelling`_ is a spelling checker for Sphinx_.  It uses
PyEnchant_ to produce a report showing misspelled words.

What's New in 1.1?
==================

This point update includes new filters to ignore words commonly
encountered in software documentation and other writing about computer
programs. These include Python language built-ins, importable modules,
words that match the names of packages on the Python Package Index,
CamelCase words, and acronyms. There is also a new ``spelling``
directive for creating a local word list within a document.
