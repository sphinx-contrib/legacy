- create tests to verify handling of relative *image* links
- improve and document the toctree-like "latest" directive

  - should this be restricted to titlesonly? - http://sphinx.pocoo.org/latest/markup/toctree.html
  - support custom date format
  - why are latest list entires marked as external references?
  - make sorting by date optional
  - make displaying date optional
  - support microformats for date display
  - rather than ignoring undated articles, include them at the bottom of the list.
  
- write rss at the `html-collect-pages` event
