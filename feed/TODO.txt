TODO
=================================================================

- create tests to verify handling of relative *image* links
- improve and document the toctree-like "latest" directive

  - why are latest list entires marked as external references?
  - make *sorting* by date optional
  - make *displaying* date optional
  - support custom date format when it *is* displayed
  - better markup for dates - need a class to attach etc

    - (blue sky) How about, then, supporting microformats for date display?

  - optionally, rather than ignoring undated articles, include them at the bottom of the list.
  - (Blue sky) support dates on links and subheadings rather than just whole
    documents (requires work with sphinx/docutils)
  - fix bug with recursive display - ATM if you explicitly include subdirs, it
    will explode when writing HTML in environment.collect_relations
  
    - testcase?
      
- write rss at the new `html-collect-pages` event
