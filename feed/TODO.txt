- create tests to verify handling of relative *image* links
- ditch python nose for plain old, way more debugging-friendly unittests
- create a toctree-like "latest" directive. note we can't simply subclass TocTree, or even simply copy it, since toctree nodes are very deep in sphinx and have specialist rendering. But we can duplicate some of the machinery. this need a custom directive, and also a toctree-like custom node (yet to come)
